# --noconfirm: This flag is used with pacman to bypass any prompts that would
# normally require user interaction.
# The escape symbol \ at the end of the line is used in shell scripting (and
# specifically in Dockerfile commands) to indicate that the command continues on
# the next line. It's a way to split long commands over multiple lines for
# better readability.

# -m: This option tells useradd to create the user's home directory if it does
# not already exist.
# "wurfkreuz ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL": This is the line being echoed. It's a
# configuration line for the sudoers file, which specifies permissions for users
# to execute commands as the superuser or other users. wurfkreuz: The username
# the rule applies to. ALL=(ALL): This specifies that the user can run commands
# as all users from all hosts.

# The line CMD ["/bin/bash"] sets the command to start a Bash shell when the
# container launches.

# 'tail' is a Unix and Linux utility that displays the end of a text file or piped data. By default, tail prints the last 10 lines of its input to the standard output (stdout).
# The -f option stands for "follow." When used with tail, it causes tail to not
# stop when the end of the file is reached, but rather to wait for additional
# data to be appended to the input. In essence, tail -f is used to continuously
# monitor the tail of a file, printing new lines as they are appended.
